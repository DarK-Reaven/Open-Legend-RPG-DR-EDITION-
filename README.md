OPEN LEGEND DR EDITION:


"Your tales is about to begin.....
who are you?, what is your purpose here in the land of vanity and pride?

Welcome to the citadel of Vernnos, Capital of the kingdom of Varthelis
and place of legends and tragedies 

there have been great names before you .... the question here is, will people remember yours and place it on history?.
The choice is yours....."

















Q&A:

- *What is the porpuse of this project?*
- 
- To tell the story i created with full an d total control of it, without licencing issues in case i wanted to properly share with the community.

- *Can you use this fork on your projects?*
-
- Absolutely, while i can not confirm on any form that Open Legend RPG may keep the open source licence they use, i can confirm that my ruleset is intented to remain open source and free of charge permanently. i have no intention to lock this system ruleset fork on any paywall (Read the license file).

-*So is everything free or open Source?*

My changes to the core original rules of Open Legend RPG are open source and are intended to remain that way, The that i will be releasing for this project includes World building, NPCs and lore in general will also be free to use but it is not open source becacuse it is part of my original creation as a writter in this case
THE VARTHELIS SAGA.


This is a project that i am making out of love and hope that will help me to improve my skills both as a GM (game master) and also a fantasy writter
if this helps you or inspire you to do the same, i would be happy to know how you use this resources.
